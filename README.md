# Application Page
This application page was made by me for a project while I was a trainee. 

## Installing
After cloning the repository to your computer with  https://github.com/atheqa/application-page.git  you can install the needed dependencies by using either the command
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```

## Using the Application Page
Use the command
```
yarn start
```
to get the app started. Open  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)  to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
